As mentioned in the previous page, SUI has started as [React headless library](https://github.com/sustainableui/sui-headless-react). This library automatically selects one component out of 3 that developer provides. This selection is made based on grid carbon intensity in area where the user is located at the time of interaction with the app. At the same time, library provides an interface for implementing a switch that enables user control.

Headless library is an abstraction for implementing sustainable UIs in general. It is a universal interface that lives below the visual components that users interact with. Headless libraries do not do anything on their own, thus they require components in order to do something.

## React library

{% callout title="Under heavy development" %}
React library has not been made production-ready yet. We are working hard to achieve this status. Latest progress can be observed in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sustainableui/sui-headless-react).
{% /callout %}

SUI headless library for React is the first SUI open-source tool. That is because of widespread use of the React library among web developers. This way, SUI can be adopted by the most visited websites in the world.

## Further plans

React library is just the beginning. SUI is a generic concept and the aim is to support all popular libraries and frameworks on the web in the near future. We are open to contributions so please make sure to let us know if you would like to help us!
