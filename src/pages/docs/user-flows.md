title: User flows

There is a [Carbon Hack 22 demo implementation](https://poc.sustainableui.com/) of [SUI Headless for React](https://github.com/sustainableui/sui-headless-react) from October 2022 that has a loading screen while the localization is in a pending state. This is a great example of what you want to avoid in UIs based on the UX analysis we have done.

When user visits the website, it should be usable as soon as possible. Endless stream of popups at majority of today's websites is a great example of a bad UX practice. SUI localizes user in the background based on IP address. For better precision, localization should be implemented client-side, worsening the UX experience.
