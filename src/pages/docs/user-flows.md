title: User flows
description:

We have made a UX analysis that identifies different flows based on localization method (IP address or precise user location) and software architecture. We realized that it is not a good thing to wait, which will likely result in a higher bounce rate.

When you look at the [Carbon Hack 22 demo implementation](https://poc.sustainableui.com/) of SUI Headless for React, there is a loading screen while the localization is happening. This is a great example of what you want to avoid in UIs.

User should be able to use the app immediately. Hence fallback mode would be preferable before suggesting the user to change the display mode.
