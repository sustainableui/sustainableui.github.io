Carbon aware UI won't work without access to the user location. Until the user location and its grid carbon intensity is known after a page load, the Carbon Loader let's the user know that localization is happening. Fallback display mode shall be provided when a user decides to skip the localization process. In ideal case scenario, the Carbon Loader won't be displayed to the user at all to prevent rise of site's bounce rate.
