In addition to designing and developing for well-being, equity and sustainability, SUI is based on 2 green mode design principles graceful degradation and user control.

## Graceful degradation

Graceful degradation degrades performance of a software while retaining its core functionality. This way, it is possible to interact with the software through multiple alternative versions. 

## User control

User control is a core UX principle that places user at center of user experience of an app. Hence, graceful degradation is optional to avoid violation of this fundamental principle.
