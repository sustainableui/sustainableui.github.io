With SUI, the user is in control of the experience and remains at its center. This is why the UI Switch allows the user to select the [Display Mode](/docs/display-mode), independent of the grid carbon intensity at a given time and location. SUI acts as a recommendation engine that does not enforce any particular Display Mode.
