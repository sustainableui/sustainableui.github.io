description: Alternative versions of UI chosen automatically by SUI or by a user.

Each grid carbon intensity is associated with one of the display modes. We believe the most used apps should offer three display modes to begin with: low, moderate and high. Low display mode is chosen when the grid carbon intensity is high and vice-versa.

SUI Display Mode primitive is inspired by the dropdown on [Branch Magazine](https://branch.climateaction.tech) from [ClimateAction.Tech](https://climateaction.tech) community.
