Each grid carbon intensity is associated with one of the Display Modes. We believe the most visited processing-heavy and data-heavy apps should offer three display modes to begin with: low, moderate and high. Low display mode is chosen when the grid carbon intensity is high and vice-versa.

SUI Display Mode primitive is inspired by the dropdown on [Branch Magazine](https://branch.climateaction.tech?utm_source=sustainableui.github.io) from [ClimateAction.Tech](https://climateaction.tech?utm_source=sustainableui.github.io) community.
