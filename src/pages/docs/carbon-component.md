A component that has one variant associated with each of the [Display Modes](/docs/display-mode). When the display mode is low, the Carbon Component selected through [Graceful Degradation Function](/docs/graceful-degradation-function) does less as grid carbon intensity is high. The opposite is true for the Carbon Component that is selected when the grid carbon intensity is high.
