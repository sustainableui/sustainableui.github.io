description: A component that is associated with one or more display modes.

A component that has one variant associated with each of the Display Modes. When the display mode is low, Carbon Component selected through [Graceful Degradation Function](/docs/graceful-degradation-function) does less as grid carbon intensity is high. The opposite is true for Carbon Component that is selected when the grid carbon intensity is high.
