Carbon awareness is a green software principle that ensures software does less job when electricity production is dirty and opposite when it is produced more from renewable energy sources.

[Green Software for Practicioners](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/green-software-for-practitioners-lfc131/) is a course by the Linux Foundation where you can learn the basic concepts a software practitioner needs to know to build, maintain and run greener applications.

SUI leverages carbon awareness principle at its core. SUI encourages designers and developers to build alternative variants of components with low, moderate and heavy carbon efficiency.

With emergence of services such as [Electricity Maps](https://electricitymaps.com) and [Watttime](https://www.watttime.org/), it is possible to leverage grid carbon intensity data for the purposes of carbon aware apps development.
