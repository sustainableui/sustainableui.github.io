[Green Software for Practicioners (LFC131)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/green-software-for-practitioners-lfc131/?utm_source=sustainableui.github.io) is a course by the Linux Foundation where you can learn the basic concepts a software practitioner needs to know to build, maintain and run greener applications.

SUI encourages designers and developers to build alternative variants of components to achieve graceful degradation so that it can automatically suggest the most fitting variant based on grid carbon intensity at a given location. With emergence of services such as [Electricity Maps](https://electricitymaps.com?utm_source=sustainableui.github.io) and [Watttime](https://www.watttime.org?utm_source=sustainableui.github.io), it is possible to leverage grid carbon intensity data for the purposes of carbon aware apps development.
