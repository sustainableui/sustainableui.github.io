title: Introduction to headless
description: Headless solution enables for separation of concerns.

Sustainability is a comprehensive topic that is hard to tackle all at once. For this reason, SUI project has kicked off during Carbon Hack 22 with [a small solution](https://taikai.network/gsf/hackathons/carbonhack22/projects/cl8j1ex3h2845301s653mtnk87/idea) that allows React web frontend developers to make web UIs carbon aware with more ease. This solution is a headless library built on top of green mode design principles we have talked about previously [here](/src/pages/docs/green-mode-design.md).

Headless solution enables for separation of concerns. On one hand, one part of the functionality is provided but on the other, visual representation is missing. For example: button does not have a meaning without a handler function (what happens when user clicks on it). Headless library for a button would represent a handler function.

In other words, SUI has begun its journey towards helping build UIs with sustainability at core with a small piece of logic that sits beneath the actual components that create the UI as users see it. This makes the concept super scalable and widely applicable.
