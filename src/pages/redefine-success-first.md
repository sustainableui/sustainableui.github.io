title: (Re)define success first
description: To redefine UIs, it means to redefine what user can and cannot do in our software.
---

Users interact with our apps through user interfaces (UIs). Sustainable UI (SUI) aims at providing recommendations and tools that could help designers and developers build UIs that have 3 core principles incorporated: well-being, equity and sustainability. SUI is focusing on UIs as apps are built around user. **To redefine UIs, it means to redefine what user can and cannot do in our software.**

In today's economy, GDP is a primary metric for measuring success. **We think this is not right, which completely changes meaning of a good digital product or software in general.**

SUI's vision is inspired by the original article from Lennart Overkamp titled "[Designers, (Re)define Success First](https://alistapart.com/article/redefine-success-first/)" on A List Apart magazine from May 2022.

## Well-being

We want to build UIs that treat user’s attention and time well.

## Equity

We want to build UIs that offer the same functionality to every human being.

## Sustainability

We want to build UIs that take electricity consumption into account.
