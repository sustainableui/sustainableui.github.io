We have documented every significant step on our way towards the goal during 2022 down below.

## 2022

### December

#### 15/12/22

- [Samuel Pitoňák](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sampittko/) (Slovakia) spoke at [Tatry IT meetup](https://www.meetup.com/tatry-it-community/events/289944114/) about [implementing Carbon Aware UIs on the web](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMh7TLkayXQ) based on previous work at Sustainable UI

### September

#### 13/11/22

- [the project has joined the Incubation Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6998207260988440576/) by the [Adora Foundation](https://adorafoundation.org) to receive pro bono mentorship, expert advice, access to global impact networks, promotion and dissemination, match-making and other in-kind support

#### 10/11/22

- [Sustainable UI](https://taikai.network/gsf/hackathons/carbonhack22/projects/cl8j1ex3h2845301s653mtnk87/idea) has won The Most Innovative award at Carbon Hack 22
    - this got announced during [Decarbonize Software](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS12M3cXwO8&t=26m26s) event by the Green Software Foundation
    - thanks goes to the project mentor [Ismael Velasco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismaelvelasco/) (Mexico) who has helped with shaping the final text pitch

### October

#### 06/10/22

- registered for the first global hackathon regarding carbon aware software called [Carbon Hack 22](https://taikai.network/gsf/hackathons/carbonhack22) by the [Green Software Foundation](https://greensoftware.foundation)
    - the solution needed to leverage [Carbon Aware API/SDK](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk) in order to participate successfully
    - at this point, Sustainable UI was an idea to make client-based JavaScript-heavy applications based on [React](https://reactjs.org/) carbon aware
    - specifically, I wanted to implement UI with "edit mode" that would allow users to switch components based on grid carbon intensity

### August

#### 13/08/22

- learned about the Green Mode Design principles graceful degradation and user control from [Ismael Velasco's blog page](https://ismaelvelasco.dev/series/green-mode-design) through [ClimateAction.Tech community](https://climateaction.tech)

### May

#### 23/05/22

- theoretical idea coined for the first time
    - at this point a very generic one without any specific actionable steps, knowing just that it has to be at intersection between web UIs and sustainability, hence the name Sustainable UI
    - further action and involvement in the area inspired by the [Principles of Green Software Engineering](https://principles.green/), Wholegrain Digital's [Sustainable Web Manifesto](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/) and membership in [ClimateAction.Tech community](https://climateaction.tech)
