title: Carbon awareness
description: Doing less when electricity is dirty and vice-versa.
---

Carbon awareness is a green software principle that ensures that software does less job when electricity production is dirty and opposite when it consists of more renewable energy.

SUI leverages carbon awareness at it's core. SUI encourages designers and developers to build alternative variants of components with low, moderate and heavy computational complexity.

With emergence of services such as [Electricity Maps](https://electricitymaps.com) and [Watttime](https://www.watttime.org/), it is possible to leverage grid carbon intensity data for the purposes of carbon aware apps development.
