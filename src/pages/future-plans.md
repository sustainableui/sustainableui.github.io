Our goal is to provide a set of recommendations and ecosystem of tools to designers and developers for building carbon aware UIs on all platforms - be it web, desktop or mobile. {% .lead %}

## The Greatest Ambition

We have started with [a small solution](/docs/introduction-to-headless) for React-based web applications but the concept is so scalable it is even hard to put into words what we want to do. **We believe that our tools will help designers and developers build UIs with sustainability at core.** But it's not only about that.

Currently, there are multiple popular libraries such as [MUI](https://mui.com), [ANT Design](https://ant.design) or [Primer](https://primer.style/react/) that provide set of components that developers work with so they do not need to build everything from scratch. **You can think of SUI as an additional layer that sits above such libraries.** This means SUI can either extend these existing popular UI tools in order to scale up or act as a standalone carbon aware UI library (more about carbon awareness [here](/docs/carbon-awareness)). 

In addition to the above, SUI redefines what success means for software in the age of climate crisis and proposes new principles that should guide new generation of software to benefit well-being, equity and sustainability. In sections that follow, you will have an opportunity to learn more about these guiding principles.
