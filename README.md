# Sustainable UI

A documentation website for Sustainable UI - a principally different approach to building frontends where the planet benefits the most while users remain at center.

The project provides core principles and open-source tools for building sustainable UIs across web, desktop, and mobile platforms. Key principles include [green mode design](https://sustainableui.github.io/docs/green-mode-design) and [carbon awareness](https://sustainableui.github.io/docs/carbon-awareness).
